# NullDM

**NullDM** is a minimalist text-based display manager for Linux, written in Rust.  
It is being developed primarily as a **learning project**, with a focus on understanding low-level Linux systems, terminal interfaces, and secure authentication.

# Goals

- **Simplicity**: Minimal interface, minimal dependencies.
- **Clarity**: Easy to read and understand codebase.
- **Education**: Built to explore how display managers work under the hood.

This is not intended to replace full-featured DMs â€” it's a lightweight and educational alternative meant to deepen your understanding of Linux login mechanisms.
